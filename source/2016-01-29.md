**Definition**: A group $(G, \star)$ is:

a. *finite* if $G$ is a finite set;
b. *infinite* if $G$ is an infinite set;
c. *abelian* (or *commutative*) if $\star$ is commutative

Two more examples of groups:

- the *trivial group* $G = \{e\}$, $e \star e = e$
- For any $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{> 0}$, $GL_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ is the group of invertible $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{R}$. The inverse in $G$ is the matrix inverse, and the identity in $G$ is the identity matrix $I_n$. This group is non-abelian (unless $n = 1$).

A word on notation: people usually don't write $\star$ for the group operation. There are two choices of notation:

a. *Multiplicative notation*: Write $ab$ instead of $a \star b$, $a^{-1}$ for the inverse of $a$ and 1 or $e$ for the identity element.
b. *Additive notation*: Write $a + b$ instead of $a \star b$, $-a$ for the inverse of $a$ and $0$ for the identity element. \
   Also define $a - b = a + (-b)$

Additive notation is *only used* for abelian groups. Multiplicative notation can be used for any group.

### Basic Properties of Groups
(see book for omitted proofs)

a. A group can have only one identity element (proved already)
b. Every $a \in G$ has only one inverse and $ab = e$ *or* $ba = e \implies b = a^{-1}$.
c. $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$
d. $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ \
   $(ab)b^{-1}a^{-1} = abb^{-1}a^{-1} = aea^{-1} = aa^{-1} = e$
e. $e^{-1} = e$ \
   $e^{-1} = e^{-1}e = e$
f. Generalized associative law: \
   in a product of $n$ elements ($n \in \mathbb{Z}$), you get the same answer no matter what order the operations are performed in. \
   **example**: $(ab)(cd) = ((ab)c)d = (a(bc))d$ \
   The proof is by strong induction on $n$.

**Proposition**: Let $G$ be a group, and let $a, b, c \in G$.

a. (Cancellation law): if $ac = bc$ then $a = b$.
b. (Another cancellation law): if $ca = cb$ then $a = b$.
c. The equation $ax = b$ has a unique solution $x \in G\ldotp x = a^{-1}b$.
d. Same for the equation $xa = b$, $x = ba^{-1}$ (not necessarily the same solution).

**Proof**:

a. $ac = bc \implies acc^{-1} = bcc^{-1} \implies ae = be \implies a = b$
b. Similar
c. $ax = b \iff a^{-1}ax = a^{-1}b \iff ex = a^{-1}b \iff x = a^{-1}b$ \
   Check by pluggin in: $a(a^{-1}b) = b$
d. Similar (be careful about lack of commutativity)

**Definition**: For a group $G$, an element $x \in G$, and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ \
    $x^{n} = \begin{cases}
        xx \ldots x \text{ (n times)} & n > 0 \\
        e & n = 0 \\
        (x^{-1})^{-n} & n < 0
    \end{cases}$ \
In additive notation, this is written $nx$. \
The usual rules for exponentials are satisfied:

- $x^{n}x^{m} = x^{n + m} \forall n, m \in \mathbb{Z}$
- $(x^{n})^{m} = x^{nm} \forall n, m \in \mathbb{Z}$

**Definition**: The order of an element $x \in G$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $x^n = e$, or $\infty$ if there is no such $n$. It is written $|x|$.

**Examples**:

- In any group, $|x| = 1 \iff x = e$
- In $\mathbb{R}$, all non-zero elements have infinite order
- In $(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ $|4| = 2$ because $4^2 = 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, but $|3| = 4$ because $3^2 = 9 \in \bar{4}, 3^{3} = 27 \in \bar{2}, 3^{4} = 81 \in \bar{1}$.

**Definition**: The cardinality of a set $A$ is the number of elements of $A$ if $A$ is finite, or $\infty$ if $A$ is infinite. (In this class, we won't distinguish between countably infinite and uncountable cardinalities). This is written $|A|$ or, sometimes, $\#A$

**Definition**: The *order* of a group $G$ is the cardinality of its set of elements, also written $|G|$ (or $\#G$).

With a group, you can write its *multiplication table*. For example:

|           | $\bar{0}$ | $\bar{1}$ | $\bar{2}$ | $\bar{3}$ |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| $\bar{0}$ | $\bar{0}$ | $\bar{1}$ | $\bar{2}$ | $\bar{3}$ |
| $\bar{1}$ | $\bar{1}$ | $\bar{2}$ | $\bar{3}$ | $\bar{0}$ |
| $\bar{2}$ | $\bar{2}$ | $\bar{3}$ | $\bar{0}$ | $\bar{1}$ |
| $\bar{3}$ | $\bar{3}$ | $\bar{0}$ | $\bar{1}$ | $\bar{2}$ |

$\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ is abelian

## Dihedral Groups

**Definition**: Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}, n \ge 3$. The *dihedral group* of order $2n$ is thg group $D_{2n}$ (som authors write it as $D_n$) is the set of symmetries of a regular n-gon. This is the set of permutations (= bijections) of the set of vertices of the n-gon that can be obtained by rigid motion of $\mathbb{R}^3$.

**See figure 1 on paper**
$D_{16}$ has 16 elements

We can think of two elements: \
$r$ = rotation clockwise by $\frac{2\pi}{n}$ radians
$s$ = flip about the line through vertex position 1 and the center

| $n$       | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $r$       | 8 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| $s$       | 1 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| $rs$      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| $sr^{-1}$ |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
