## Loose Ends
1. On homework, you can use the results of earlier problems in the book without proving them.
2. If $A$ and $B$ are groups, then $A \times B = \{(a, b) : a \in A, b \in B\}$ is also a group, with $(a_1, b_1)(a_2, b_2) = (a_1a_2, b_1b_2)$. \
Note that $(a, b)^n = (a^n, b^n)$ for all $a \in A, b \in B, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (prove by induction for $n > 0$, etc.).
3. Let $G$ be a group, let $x \in G$, and assume that $x$ has finite order $n$. Then (for $m \in \mathbb{Z}$), $x^m = 1 \iff n \mid m$.\
**Proof**:
    - "$\implies$": If $n \mid m$ then $nq = m$ for some $q \in \mathbb{Z}$, and $\therefore$ $x^m = x^{nq} = (x^n)^q = 1^q = 1$.
    - "$\impliedby$": Assume $x^m = 1$. Write $m = nq + r$ with $q, r \in \mathbb{Z}, 0 \le r < n$. Then $x^{nq + r} = 1$, so $1 = x^{nq}x^r = (x^n)^q x^r = 1^q x^r = x^r$, and that implies $r = 0$ (if $r \neq 0$ then $x^r = 1$ with $0 < r < n$, contradicting the definition of order of $x$). Then $m = nq$, so $n \mid m$.
4. When I refer to $\mathbb{Z, Q, R, C}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ as groups, the operations is *addition*. When I refer to $\mathbb{Q}^*, \mathbb{R}^*, \mathbb{C}^*$, or $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*$ as groups, the operation is *multiplication*.

$r$ = rotation clockwise by $\frac{2\pi}{8}$ radians
$s$ = flip about the line through vertex position 1 and the center

| $n$          | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $r(n)$       | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 1 |
| $s(n)$       | 1 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| $rs$         | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| $sr^{-1}$    | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

$\therefore rs = sr^{-1}$. \
Also $r^2s = r(rs) = r(sr^{-1}) = (rs)r^{-1} = sr^{-1}r^{-1} = sr^{-2}$ \
Generally, $r^{n + 1}s = rr^ns = rsr^{-n} = sr^{-1}r^{-n} = sr^{-(n + 1)}$ \
$\therefore$ by induction, $r^is = sr^{-i}$ for all $i \in \mathbb{Z}$. \
$r^n = 1$ and $s^2 = 1$. \
We have $D_{2n} = \{1, r, r^2, \ldots, r^{n - 1}, s, sr, sr^{2}, \ldots, sr^{n - 1}\}$, and these expressions all give different elements of $D_{2n}$. \
Here $r$ and $s$ *generate* $D_{2n}$.

**Definition**: A subset $S$ of a group $G$ *generates* $G$ if every element of $G$ can be written as a (finite) product of (positive or negative) integer powers of elements of $S$. If $S$ generates $G$, then we also say that $S$ is a *generating set* for $G$.\
**Examples**:

- $\{r, s\}$ generates $D_{2n}\ \forall n$
- For any group $G$, $G$ generates itself.
- $S = \emptyset$ generates the trivial group (1 = empty product)

Then $D_{2n}$ can be fully described by:

i. elements $r$ and $s$ generate $D_{2n}$, and
ii. for any two expressions in $r$ and $s$, those two expressions give the same element of $D_{2n}$ if and only if this equality can be deduced from the equalities $r^n = 1, s^2 = 1, rs = sr^{-1}$ (these are called *relations*).

(i) and (ii) (collectively) are an example of a presentation of a group.

**Definition**: A *presentation* of a group $G$ is an expression $G = \langle S | R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_m \rangle$, where $S$ is a generating set for $G$, and each $R_i$ is an equation in the elements of $S \cup \{1\}$ such that any (true) equation from the elements of $S$ can be deduced from $R_1, \ldots, R_m$. \
**Example**:

- $\mathbb{Q}^{\times} = \langle \{2, 3, \ldots, -1\} | (-1)^2 = 1, pq = qp\ \forall p, q \in S \rangle$
- trivial group = $\langle \emptyset | \rangle$

The $R_i$ are called *relations*, and the presentation of $G$ is also called a *description of $G$ using generators and relations*.

Elements of $S$ are called *generators*. \
*Caution*: Referring to an element of $G$ as a generator is only valid if it is understood what the set $S$ is.

How do you work with these? \
To check whether a given group is described by a given presentation $\langle S | R_1, \ldots, R_m \rangle$:

1. Check that $S$ generates $G$ and that $R_1, \ldots, R_m$ are true in $G$.
2. Check that you have enough relations; in other words, that every equation in the elements of $S \cup \{1\}$ can be deduced from $R_1, \ldots, R_m$ (to do this it may help to find, for each element of $G$ an expression in the elements of $S$ that equals that element and then show that all other such expressions are equal to one of the chosen expressions).

**Example**: $D_{2n} = \{1, r, r^2, \ldots, r^{n - 1}, s, sr, \ldots, sr^{n - 1}\}$ (using $rs = sr^{-1}$).
